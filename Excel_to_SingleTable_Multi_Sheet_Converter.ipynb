        "## What It Does\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Input:** Any Excel workbook (.xlsx file)\n",
        "* **Output:** Single organized CSV file containing all sheets\n",
        "* **Process:** Automatically extracts and combines all sheets while preserving their names and structure\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "* Preserves original sheet names as section headers in the CSV\n",
        "* Shows preview of each sheet's data during processing\n",
        "* Reports detailed statistics (rows, columns, memory usage)\n",
        "* Handles large Excel files efficiently\n",
