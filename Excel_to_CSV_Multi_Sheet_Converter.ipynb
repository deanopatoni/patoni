        "\n",
        "This Python script provides a powerful yet simple way to convert Excel workbooks (XLSX files) into a single, well-organized CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What It Does\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Input:** Any Excel workbook (.xlsx file)\n",
        "* **Output:** Single organized CSV file containing all sheets\n",
        "* **Process:** Automatically extracts and combines all sheets while preserving their names and structure\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "* Preserves original sheet names as section headers in the CSV\n",
        "* Shows preview of each sheet's data during processing\n",
        "* Reports detailed statistics (rows, columns, memory usage)\n",
        "* Handles large Excel files efficiently\n",
        "* Provides error handling and progress updates\n",
        "* Gives user control over final download\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Run the script\n",
        "2. Click 'Upload' when prompted\n",
        "3. Select your Excel file\n",
        "4. Review the data previews that appear\n",
        "5. Type 'yes' when asked to download\n",
        "6. Get your combined CSV file!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Output Format\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting CSV will look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
